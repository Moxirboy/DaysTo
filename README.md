# DaysTo
Days to 2025 Calculator
This is a simple Go program that calculates the number of days remaining until January 1, 2025, when provided with a valid token as a URL query parameter.

Prerequisites
Go (Golang) must be installed on your system.
A valid token (replace your_secret_token with your actual token).
Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Replace your_secret_token in the code with your actual token.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code.

Run the Go program using the following command:

shell
Copy code
go run main.go
The server will start and listen on port 8080.

To calculate the days remaining until January 1, 2025, access the following URL in your web browser or use a tool like cURL:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/?token=your_token
Replace your_secret_token with your actual token.

If a valid token is provided, the server will respond with the number of days remaining. If the token is missing or incorrect, a 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
